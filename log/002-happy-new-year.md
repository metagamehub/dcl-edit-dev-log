# 002 - Happy New Year

After a short holiday, we are back with the weekly dev log. Despite the holiday, we've continued our work on dcl-edit. 

## UI Test suit

dcl-edit contains a lot of UI. From input fields in the inspector to the context menu when right-clicking on stuff.
For that, we have developed a UI Builder, which purpose it is, to make it easier to add new UI. But it needs to be 
tested. For that, we created the UI Test suit. It's a semi-automated test, that will show some UI to a tester (a person)
and prompt the tester with a task or a question. That way, we can quickly see, if the UI still works as intended.
